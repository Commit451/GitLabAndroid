## Issues
Please see the [issues](https://gitlab.com/Commit451/LabCoat/issues) section to report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues.

## Building
You should be able to build the project from Android Studio without any further setup. The app uses Fabric for crash reporting, so if you wanted to do a release build, you would need to generate your own Crashlytics/Fabric key. All in all, your `gradle.properties` will look something like this:
```Gradle
LABCOAT_FABRIC_KEY = FABRIC_KEY_GOES_HERE_BUT_ONLY_REALLY_NEEDED_FOR_RELEASE_BUILDS
```

To build, run the following.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
